# Phase - 1 Projects

This section provides an overview of the projects completed during Phase 1 of the development cycle. The Phase 1 projects include a Golden Task and a Normal Task.

## Golden Task - House Price Prediction

The Golden Task for Phase 1 is the House Price Prediction project. In this project, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, etc. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The ultimate goal is to create a robust and reliable house price prediction system that can be used for real estate purposes.

## Normal Task - IMDB Data Analysis

The Normal Task for Phase 1 is the IMDB Data Analysis project. The objective of this project is to analyze the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) dataset and gain insights into the movie industry. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical analysis. By examining the dataset, we aim to uncover interesting trends, patterns, and correlations related to movie ratings, genres, actors, directors, and other relevant factors. The insights obtained from this analysis can be valuable for filmmakers, studios, and movie enthusiasts.

# Phase - 2 Projects

This section provides an overview of the projects planned for Phase 2 of the development cycle. Similar to Phase 1, Phase 2 includes a Golden Task and a Normal Task.

## Golden Task - Speech Emotion Recognition

The Golden Task for Phase 2 is the Speech Emotion Recognition project. In this project, our objective is to develop a system that can recognize and classify emotions from speech signals. Emotions play a crucial role in human communication, and being able to automatically identify them from speech can have various applications, such as in customer service, mental health analysis, and human-computer interaction. The project will involve tasks such as audio signal processing, feature extraction, machine learning model development, and evaluation.

## Normal Task - Diabetes Prediction

The Normal Task for Phase 2 is the Diabetes Prediction project. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on certain factors such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, insulin levels, etc. Early detection of diabetes risk can enable timely intervention and better management of the condition. The project will involve data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The resulting model can be used to assess the risk of diabetes for individuals and support healthcare professionals in their decision-making process.
